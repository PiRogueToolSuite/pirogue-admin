pirogue-admin (1.0.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Ship pirogue-admin under /usr/sbin instead of /usr/bin. Users should
    be using commands provided by pirogue-admin-client.
  * Use the logging module instead of print() in various places.
  * Add variables support to the SUPPORTED_CONDITIONS dict, and ensure all
    needed variables can be gathered and checked accordingly.
  * Add condition validation to the index.yaml parsing.
  * Add initial support for condition and actions_else, in addition to
    regular actions support. The combination of actions, condition, and
    actions_else is going to be very useful to configure and enable
    a service (if the condition is met), and to deconfigure and disable
    a service (if it isn't). To make sure we can toggle a condition and
    have actions run in both cases, it seems easier to have a slight
    asymmetry:
     - If the condition is fulfilled, actions are run if the contents of
       the file change.
     - If the condition is not fulfilled, the file is removed (not keeping
       outdated/irrelevant contents around), and actions_else are run
       unconditionally.
  * Make the DNSMASQ condition implementation consider the SYSTEM_DNSMASQ
    variable, but only in the APPLIANCE mode (since the AP mode absolutely
    requires it).
  * Hardcode SYSTEM_DNSMASQ in the autodetection code for the time being.
    Users can turn it off if they so wish. We probably want to move to
    a different distinction anyway: have dnsmasq available in any case,
    but only enable DHCP conditionally.
  * Add initial systemd-networkd/systemd-resolved support, allowing to
    configure the isolated network.
  * Finally, mark APPLIANCE mode as supported.
